## What This Is

Mnemonic Realms is a single-player 16-bit JRPG about memory as creative vitality. The gorgeous pixel art is always visible, always beautiful. Vibrancy manifests as spatial fog-of-war: forgotten areas are dark, partially remembered areas glow through colored haze, and fully remembered areas are crystal clear. Quest progression unlocks the world visually — replacing traditional RPG area-gates with a memory-aligned metaphor.

**Engine**: MnemonicEngine — Expo (React Native) + React Native Skia + Koota ECS. Web-first via Expo web, with iOS/Android architecture ready.

**RPG-JS has been archived** to `docs/rpgjs-archive/`. Do not modify archived files. They are preserved as reference context.

## CRITICAL RULES -- DO NOT VIOLATE

1. **RPG-JS is archived.** All RPG-JS code lives in `docs/rpgjs-archive/`. Never modify it. Never reference it from active code. It exists as context only.

2. **16x16 pixel tiles everywhere.** All premium tilesets. Maps sized accordingly (60x60 = 960px).

3. **The gorgeous art is ALWAYS visible.** Vibrancy is spatial fog-of-war (forgotten=dark, partial=haze, remembered=clear), NOT desaturation or color tinting. Player's active area is never degraded. Don't use visual props to tell the story — tell it through narrative, dialogue, and world events.

4. **Story drives everything.** Think Hobbit, not acts/scenes. Bag End is intimate but the world is immediately vast. Open world, open map, transitions to other worlds.

5. **Never hand-edit generated output.** The assemblage system generates maps. Runtime JSON is generated by `emit-runtime`. Edit the source (DDL, assemblages, docs/world/), not the output.

6. **Build automation, not artifacts.** When the next step requires manual repetition, STOP. Build the tool.

7. **You are the creative director.** If something reads like a placeholder, fix it. No confirmation needed.

8. **Logic in subpackages, not TSX.** TSX files contain ONLY rendering markup + hooks. Business logic lives in `engine/` subpackages.

9. **Encounters are a World.** Combat and special moments transition to the encounters world — same onion hierarchy as shops, dungeons, overworld.

## PRD + Ralph TUI Execution

The full PRD lives at `tasks/prd-mnemonic-engine.md` (26 user stories). The Ralph JSON lives at `tasks/prd.json`, ready for:

```bash
ralph-tui run --prd tasks/prd.json
```

Ralph creates independent worktrees off `main` for parallel story execution. Stories with no blocking dependencies can run simultaneously.

## Core Concepts

### Worlds All The Way Down

Everything is a **world**. A shop is a world. A dungeon is a world. The outdoor map is a world. Combat encounters are a world. Everything composes fractally: World -> Regions -> Anchors -> World Slots -> Child Worlds.

**Full details**: [docs/design/world-architecture.md](docs/design/world-architecture.md)

### Encounters World

Combat and special moments are NOT modal overlays. They are a **world** in the onion hierarchy:

- **Regions** = encounter classes (e.g., `settled-lands-wildlife`, `frontier-elementals`)
- **Locations** = specific encounters within a class (e.g., `wolf-pack`, `slime-swarm`)
- Default layout: Final Fantasy / Chrono Trigger split-screen (enemies top, commands bottom)
- Encounters chain: combat -> dialogue -> surprise -> combat
- DDL-driven: `gen/ddl/encounters/` with Zod validation
- Random encounter pools specified per overworld region

### Vibrancy as Spatial Fog-of-War

Instead of traditional RPG area-gating (invisible walls, story triggers), areas are gated by **memory state**:

| Area State | Visual | Gameplay |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| **Forgotten** | Opaque darkness | Player can enter a few paces, then warned + damage until they leave |
| **Partial** | Colored haze (invitation) | Player knows it's time to explore here |
| **Remembered** | Crystal clear, full gorgeous art | Fully accessible, no visual filter |

Quest progression drives state transitions. Per-area, not global. Player's active area is **always** beautiful.

### Koota ECS

Data-oriented ECS with SoA (struct-of-arrays) storage. Chosen for:
- Deterministic iteration order (renders maps from instruction sets predictably)
- Cache-friendly trait access patterns
- From pmndrs ecosystem (same team as Miniplex, Three.js ecosystem)

---

## Architecture (Quick Reference)

### Engine (`engine/`)

Koota ECS + pure systems + Skia renderers.

- `engine/ecs/` — World, traits, queries
- `engine/ecs/systems/` — Pure functions: movement, collision, camera, interaction, npc-ai, vibrancy, particles, encounter
- `engine/renderer/` — Skia Atlas tile/sprite/particle renderers, camera, fog-of-war shader
- `engine/world/` — Map loader, entity spawner, world transitions
- `engine/encounters/` — Encounter world system, combat engine, chain executor
- `engine/audio/` — BGM + SFX with BiquadFilterNode low-pass vibrancy sweep
- `engine/save/` — Serialization to AsyncStorage/localStorage
- `engine/inventory/` — Item management, equipment, shop transactions
- `engine/input.ts` — Platform-agnostic input (keyboard + touch)
- `engine/game-loop.ts` — 60fps via Reanimated `useFrameCallback`

### App (`app/`)

Expo Router pages.

- `app/_layout.tsx` — Root layout
- `app/index.tsx` — Title screen route
- `app/game.tsx` — Game canvas route

### UI (`ui/`)

React Native components (NOT Skia) overlaying the game canvas.

- `ui/dialogue-box.tsx` — Typewriter text, portraits, choices
- `ui/combat-ui.tsx` — Split-screen encounter UI
- `ui/hud.tsx` — Zone placard, HP bar, vibrancy meter
- `ui/inventory-screen.tsx` — Parchment grid, equipment
- `ui/shop-screen.tsx` — Buy/sell with keeper personality
- `ui/quest-log.tsx` — Callum's journal style
- `ui/title-screen.tsx` — Class selection, logo animation
- `ui/theme/` — Gluestack UI theme tokens

### GenAI Pipeline (`gen/`)

- `gen/assemblage/` — Composable map building system
- `gen/assemblage/pipeline/` — Canvas, TMX serializer, **runtime JSON serializer**, event codegen
- `gen/assemblage/compiler/` — Markdown world compiler, scene compiler
- `gen/assemblage/catalog/` — Markdown assemblage definitions (atoms -> molecules -> organisms)
- `gen/ddl/` — Data Definition Layer (scenes, maps, encounters, enemies, items)
- `gen/schemas/` — Zod schemas for all DDL types
- `gen/manifests/` — Generation status tracking

### Data (`data/`)

Runtime JSON output consumed by the engine at load time.

- `data/maps/` — Runtime map JSON (generated by `pnpm assemblage emit-runtime`)
- `data/encounters/` — Runtime encounter JSON

### Bible Docs (`docs/`)

- `docs/story/` — **Primary driver.** Act scripts, characters, dialogue-bank
- `docs/world/` — Region + location hierarchy (compilable DDL source of truth)
- `docs/design/` — Architecture, visual direction, systems design
- `docs/plans/` — Design docs and implementation plans
- `docs/rpgjs-archive/` — Archived RPG-JS code (read-only reference)

### Key Patterns

- **Expo + Skia + Koota**: React Native for cross-platform, Skia Atlas for GPU tile rendering, Koota ECS for deterministic game state
- **Worlds all the way down**: Everything is a world. Shops, dungeons, encounters, overworld.
- **Assemblage composition**: Maps built from reusable markdown-defined pieces
- **DDL-driven everything**: Maps, encounters, quests, dialogue — all Zod-validated JSON from DDL
- **Runtime JSON**: Engine loads `data/maps/*.json` directly. No TMX at runtime.
- **Fog-of-war vibrancy**: Per-area spatial effect, not global shader. Quest-driven.
- **Audio vibrancy**: BiquadFilterNode low-pass sweep (2000Hz muffled -> 20000Hz vivid)

### Config Files

- `app.json` — Expo app config
- `biome.json` — Biome 2.3: 2-space indent, single quotes, semicolons, 100 char width
- `tsconfig.json` — TypeScript config (excludes `docs/rpgjs-archive/`)
- `metro.config.js` — Metro bundler (excludes `docs/rpgjs-archive/`)
- `tailwind.config.js` — NativeWind / Tailwind config
- `package.json` — Expo + Skia + Koota + Reanimated deps

### CI

GitHub Actions: pnpm install -> lint -> test:unit -> build:web -> deploy `dist/` to GitHub Pages.
