  description:
    "Palm-sized beetles with shells of bark and thorn. They cluster near fallen logs and root tangles. Their thorny backs make them painful to hit — dealing physical damage to them has a 15% chance to deal 5 recoil damage to the attacker. They're slow but tough, and they always fight to the last.",
