# Story Structure

## Genre

JRPG. Authored content, not roguelike. One world, deeply crafted. An internal RNG seed (buried, never shown to the player) controls minor variance (enemy drops, NPC dialogue selection, terrain details) but not the story arc or major content.

## Three-Act Structure

### Act I: Awakening (The Village & Settled Lands)

**Theme**: Discovery — learning what memory can do.

The player arrives in the hub village as a newly recognized Mnemonic Architect. The world is bright, the village is warm, and everything seems fine. The player learns the basics:

- Memory collection (picking up fragments from the environment)
- Memory sharing (giving fragments to NPCs to evolve their dialogue, quests, and behaviors)
- Basic combat against Frontier creatures
- First encounter with a small Stagnation Zone — a frozen clearing near the village that nobody thinks much about

**Act I Climax**: The player discovers the Stagnation Zone is growing. An NPC the player has been building a relationship with gets caught at its edge — frozen mid-sentence. The player's first real encounter with the Preservers, who explain (politely, reasonably) that they're protecting the world.

### Act II: Expansion (The Frontier)

**Theme**: Growth vs. Preservation — the tension becomes real.

The player pushes into the Frontier, where the world is less formed and the Preservers are more active. Key beats:

- **Recalling the first dormant god**: A major set piece where the player's choices permanently shape a deity
- **Frontier settlements**: Communities that want to grow but are being pressured by Preservers to "stop changing"
- **Dissolved memory dungeons**: Deep dives into ancient civilizations' memory deposits, revealing WHY they chose to dissolve
- **Moral complexity**: The player encounters situations where preservation IS the right call — a beloved tradition being carelessly remixed, a community's identity being diluted by too much change too fast

**Act II Climax**: The Preservers' leader reveals their endgame — they've found the world's "First Memory," the original seed that started everything. They intend to crystallize it, which would freeze the entire world permanently. Beautiful. Perfect. Dead.

### Act III: Renaissance (The Sketch & The Depths)

**Theme**: Creation — choosing to build something new.

The player must reach the First Memory before the Preservers. This means pushing into the Sketch (the world's unfinished edge) and the Depths (where the densest dissolved memories lie).

- **The Sketch** is abstract and strange — half-formed landscapes that the player must remember into solidity to traverse
- **The Depths** contain the most powerful dissolved memories, including fragments of the original civilizations that created the dormant gods
- **Final dungeon**: The Preservers' crystalline fortress — a museum of frozen perfection that the player must navigate without being caught in the stasis

**Act III Climax**: The player reaches the First Memory. The choice is NOT "destroy vs. preserve." The player **remixes** it — combining the First Memory with everything they've collected throughout the game to create something new. The world doesn't return to a previous state. It leaps forward into something that never existed before.

## Ending

The world blooms. Every area the player touched becomes more vivid. NPCs the player invested in evolve to their fullest forms. The dormant gods fully awaken in whatever form the player chose. The Preservers aren't destroyed — they're given a role as memory keepers (archivists, not jailers).

The final image: the player standing at the world's edge, watching new land sketch itself into existence. Not an ending — a beginning.

## What This Is NOT

- No chosen one prophecy. The player is talented, not destined.
- No dying world rescue. The world is growing, not shrinking.
- No grimdark twist. The tone stays hopeful throughout.
- No morality meter. Player choices have consequences but aren't scored as "good" or "evil."
- An internal RNG seed drives minor variance. It is never exposed to the player.
