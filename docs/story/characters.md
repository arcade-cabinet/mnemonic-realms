## Player Character

The player character is not a "chosen one." They are a **newly recognized Mnemonic Architect** — someone who has always had a natural affinity for memory work but only recently learned to do it intentionally.

### Backstory (light, not heavy)
The player comes from the hub village. They've always noticed things others don't — echoes around Resonance Stones, the shimmer at the world's unfinished edges. When a traveling Architect passes through the village and recognizes their talent, they're invited to learn the craft.

This keeps the opening grounded: the player has a home, a community, and relationships. They're not an amnesiac, not an orphan, not plucked from another world. They're a local kid who turns out to be good at the thing the world needs most.

### Player Agency
The player's name, class, and appearance are chosen at character creation. Their personality is expressed through gameplay choices (which memories to broadcast, which NPCs to invest in, how to recall gods) rather than dialogue trees.

## Named NPCs

All 14 named NPCs have unique citizen sprites (`assets/sprites/npcs/citizens/{gender}/{Name}/{Name}.png`).

### Hana (Mentor Figure)
**Sprite:** `female/Hana/Hana.png` | **Sprite ID:** `npc_hana`

The traveling Architect who recognizes the player's talent. Mid-30s, practical, warm but not sentimental. She teaches the player the three memory operations (collect, remix, broadcast) during Act I.

**Role**: Tutorial guide, early quest-giver, emotional anchor. She gets caught in the Act I climax stagnation event, giving the player personal motivation to understand and fight the Preservers.

**Not a damsel**: Hana gets frozen because she's actively fighting the Stagnation Zone when it expands, not because she wandered into danger. When the player eventually frees her, she immediately returns to work.

### Artun (Village Elder)
**Sprite:** `male/Artun/Artun.png` | **Sprite ID:** `npc_artun`

The hub village's elder. Old, kind, knows more about the Dissolved civilizations than anyone living. His stories are one of the player's earliest sources of memory fragments.

**Role**: World-building, lore delivery, emotional grounding. He represents what the Preservers claim to protect — tradition, continuity, living memory. But he's firmly against freezing things in place: "A memory you can't change isn't a memory. It's a tombstone."

### Grym — The Curator (Primary Antagonist)
**Sprite:** `male/Grym/Grym.png` | **Sprite ID:** `npc_grym`

Leader of the Preservers. Not a cackling villain — a true believer. Grym genuinely loves the world and is terrified that change will destroy it. He's seen what happens when memories are carelessly remixed (communities lose their identity, traditions vanish, the dissolved civilizations are proof that dissolution isn't always voluntary).

**Title**: Known publicly as "The Curator." His personal name Grym is learned only after the player earns enough trust or confrontation to see behind the mask.

**Design**: Elegant, calm, speaks in measured tones. His stagnation zones are genuinely beautiful — perfect crystalline snapshots of the world at its peak. The horror is that Grym can't see the difference between a snapshot and a living moment.

**Arc**: Grym isn't defeated in combat (though Preserver agents are). He is persuaded, confronted with evidence, or simply proven wrong by the player's actions. In the ending, Grym accepts a reduced role — archiving memories without freezing them.

### Khali (Shopkeeper)
**Sprite:** `female/Khali/Khali.png` | **Sprite ID:** `npc_khali`

The hub village's general goods shopkeeper. Round, cheerful, knows every item's story. She's the player's primary commerce interface in Act I.

**Role**: Equipment vendor, gossip source, early side-quest giver. Her shop inventory expands as zone vibrancy increases — she sources goods from newly-awakened regions.

### Hark (Blacksmith)
**Sprite:** `male/Hark/Hark.png` | **Sprite ID:** `npc_hark`

The hub village's weapon and armor smith. Broad, muscular, quiet. Hark speaks through his craft — every piece he forges carries a memory of the metal's origin.

**Role**: Weapon/armor crafting and upgrades. His forge is one of the first locations where the player sees how memory broadcasting can enhance a craftsperson's work. Higher vibrancy = better equipment options.

### Nyro (Innkeeper)
**Sprite:** `male/Nyro/Nyro.png` | **Sprite ID:** `npc_nyro`

The hub village's innkeeper. Stocky, warm smile, always has a story ready. His inn is the social center of the village and the player's home base.

**Role**: Rest/save point, rumor system (hints about available quests), party management hub. Nyro hears things from travelers and shares tips about what's happening in different zones.

### Nel (Ridge Guide)
**Sprite:** `female/Nel/Nel.png` | **Sprite ID:** `npc_nel`

A weathered, lean guide who knows every path through the Ridgewalker territories. Nel has spent decades navigating the frontier's dangerous terrain.

**Role**: Mountain/frontier zone guide. Teaches the player about environmental hazards and zone transitions. Her knowledge unlocks shortcuts through difficult terrain as the player's reputation grows.

### Janik (Sunridge Keeper)
**Sprite:** `male/Janik/Janik.png` | **Sprite ID:** `npc_janik`

The keeper of Sunridge Overlook, a high vantage point where light-based memory phenomena are strongest. Young, pale gold hair, carries a brass telescope.

**Role**: Act II pivotal NPC. Janik guards the approach to the dormant god Luminos. His quests involve restoring the light-bridges that connect elevated zones. He provides lore about how the Dissolved used light as a communication medium.

### Julz (Flickerveil Warden)
**Sprite:** `female/Julz/Julz.png` | **Sprite ID:** `npc_julz`

Tall woman who patrols the borders of the Flickerveil — the zone where reality grows thin and memory echoes become visible. She keeps people from wandering into dangerous resonance fields.

**Role**: Act II gatekeeper. Julz controls access to the Flickerveil's inner reaches, requiring the player to prove they can handle memory distortion before proceeding. Her quests test the player's understanding of the remix mechanic.

### Reza (Flickerveil Elder)
**Sprite:** `male/Reza/Reza.png` | **Sprite ID:** `npc_reza`

The eldest resident of the Flickerveil settlements. Hunched, faded indigo robes, lantern staff. He's lived with the veil's distortions for so long that he's partly phased — sometimes speaking to people who aren't there, or remembering futures.

**Role**: Lore source for the Flickerveil's history. His "confused" dialogue often contains critical hints about the dormant gods. He provides the emotional case for why memory preservation matters — even the painful memories.

### Vash (Marsh Researcher)
**Sprite:** `female/Vash/Vash.png` | **Sprite ID:** `npc_vash`

A wiry researcher studying the unique memory phenomena in the marshlands. Nervous energy, mud-stained coat, many pouches full of samples. She's documenting how memories dissolve naturally vs. how the Preservers freeze them.

**Role**: Science/lore NPC. Vash provides the analytical perspective on memory mechanics. Her research notes are collectible memory fragments. She's one of the few NPCs who understands the technical side of what the player does.

### Meza (Audiomancer of Ambergrove)
**Sprite:** `female/Meza/Meza.png` | **Sprite ID:** `npc_meza`

A senior audiomancer — one of the rare practitioners who can hear the resonance of memories embedded in the world. Meza maintains the sound-wells of Ambergrove, the settlement closest to where the dormant god Resonance sleeps.

**Role**: First audiomancer the player meets. She explains how sound connects to memory and introduces the Resonance god questline. Her sound-wells serve as fast-travel waypoints when restored. She's practical and grounded despite practicing what looks like magic.

### Seza (Healer of Thornveil)
**Sprite:** `female/Seza/Seza.png` | **Sprite ID:** `npc_seza`

An herbalist and healer working in Thornveil, the zone where stagnation sickness first appears. Elderly, patient, with deep knowledge of how the body responds to frozen memory fields.

**Role**: Healing services and stagnation lore. Seza treats NPCs affected by proximity to Stagnation Zones. Her quests involve gathering ingredients that only grow in zones with specific vibrancy levels, teaching the player that the world's health and the land's vitality are connected.

### Serek (Preserver Lieutenant)
**Sprite:** `male/Serek/Serek.png` | **Sprite ID:** `npc_serek`

Grym's most trusted lieutenant and field commander. Unlike Grym's philosophical approach, Serek is a pragmatist — he enforces the Preservers' will because he's seen communities torn apart by uncontrolled memory dissolution.

**Role**: Mid-game antagonist who can become a late-game ally. Serek carries out the Stagnation Zone expansions and confronts the player directly in Acts II-III. His potential turn depends on player choices — if shown that controlled change is possible, he defects. If the player is reckless with memory remixing, Serek doubles down. He's the Preserver the player fights; Grym is the Preserver the player debates.

## Dormant Gods

### Resonance (First Recall)

The first dormant god the player encounters. Originally a prototype god of sound, Resonance has been dormant since the civilization that created it dissolved.

**The player's choice**: The emotion-type of the memory fragments used to recall Resonance determines their new form:
- Joy → God of Song (buffs and healing auras)
- Fury → God of Thunder (offensive power, weather control)
- Sorrow → God of Silence (stealth, protection, void magic)
- Awe → God of Harmony (balance, multi-element mastery)

This is a permanent, world-altering choice. The recalled god becomes an ambient presence in the game world, affecting weather, NPC behavior, and available side quests.

### Verdance (Second Recall)
God of growth and living things. Dormant in the overgrown heart of the frontier.

### Luminos (Third Recall)
God of light and revelation. Dormant at Sunridge Overlook, where Janik keeps watch.

### Kinesis (Fourth Recall)
God of motion and transformation. Dormant in the deepest dungeon, where even time seems frozen.

## Template NPCs

In addition to the 14 named characters, the world is populated by template-based NPCs that reuse citizen sprites with different sprite IDs. These provide visual variety through the 14 citizen designs plus 3 guard variants.

**Role archetypes** (each assigned a citizen sprite):
| Role | Default Sprite | Description |
|------|---------------|-------------|
| Villager | *rotates through all citizens* | Generic townsfolk with personality-keyed dialogue |
| Merchant | Serek | Traveling traders and market vendors |
| Farmer | Artun | Agricultural workers in settled zones |
| Scholar | Reza | Researchers and book-keepers |
| Guard | Guard sprites (3 variants) | Settlement and zone protectors |
| Child | Julz | Young villagers |
| Elder | Grym | Senior community members |
| Fisher | Serek | Dockside and lakeside workers |
| Innkeeper | Nyro | Tavern and rest-stop operators |
| Woodcutter | Hark | Frontier workers and lumber gatherers |
| Audiomancer | Meza | Sound-magic practitioners |
| Preserver Agent | Serek | Preserver faction field operatives |

**Template dialogue system:**
- Personality-keyed dialogue variants filled from authored NPC properties
- Variable interpolation (`{zone}`, `{mood}`, `{vibrancy_tier}`) for contextual flavor
- Micro-quest hooks tied to zone vibrancy thresholds

These NPCs are the "connective tissue" of the world. They can be brightened by memory broadcasting, which evolves their dialogue and unlocks new micro-quests. But they don't drive the main story — that's reserved for the 14 named characters.
