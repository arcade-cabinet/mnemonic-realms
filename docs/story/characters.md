# Key Characters

## Player Character

The player character is not a "chosen one." They are a **newly recognized Mnemonic Architect** — someone who has always had a natural affinity for memory work but only recently learned to do it intentionally.

### Backstory (light, not heavy)
The player comes from the hub village. They've always noticed things others don't — echoes around Resonance Stones, the shimmer at the world's unfinished edges. When a traveling Architect passes through the village and recognizes their talent, they're invited to learn the craft.

This keeps the opening grounded: the player has a home, a community, and relationships. They're not an amnesiac, not an orphan, not plucked from another world. They're a local kid who turns out to be good at the thing the world needs most.

### Player Agency
The player's name, class, and appearance are chosen at character creation. Their personality is expressed through gameplay choices (which memories to broadcast, which NPCs to invest in, how to recall gods) rather than dialogue trees.

## Named NPCs

### Lira (Mentor Figure)

The traveling Architect who recognizes the player's talent. Mid-30s, practical, warm but not sentimental. She teaches the player the three memory operations (collect, remix, broadcast) during Act I.

**Role**: Tutorial guide, early quest-giver, emotional anchor. She gets caught in the Act I climax stagnation event, giving the player personal motivation to understand and fight the Preservers.

**Not a damsel**: Lira gets frozen because she's actively fighting the Stagnation Zone when it expands, not because she wandered into danger. When the player eventually frees her, she immediately returns to work.

### Callum (Village Elder)

The hub village's elder. Old, kind, knows more about the Dissolved civilizations than anyone living. His stories are one of the player's earliest sources of memory fragments.

**Role**: World-building, lore delivery, emotional grounding. He represents what the Preservers claim to protect — tradition, continuity, living memory. But he's firmly against freezing things in place: "A memory you can't change isn't a memory. It's a tombstone."

### The Curator (Primary Antagonist)

Leader of the Preservers. Not a cackling villain — a true believer. The Curator genuinely loves the world and is terrified that change will destroy it. They've seen what happens when memories are carelessly remixed (communities lose their identity, traditions vanish, the dissolved civilizations are proof that dissolution isn't always voluntary).

**Design**: Elegant, calm, speaks in measured tones. Their stagnation zones are genuinely beautiful — perfect crystalline snapshots of the world at its peak. The horror is that the Curator can't see the difference between a snapshot and a living moment.

**Arc**: The Curator isn't defeated in combat (though Preserver agents are). The Curator is persuaded, confronted with evidence, or simply proven wrong by the player's actions. In the ending, the Curator accepts a reduced role — archiving memories without freezing them.

### Resonance (Dormant God, First Recall)

The first dormant god the player encounters. Originally a prototype god of sound, Resonance has been dormant since the civilization that created it dissolved.

**The player's choice**: The emotion-type of the memory fragments used to recall Resonance determines their new form:
- Joy → God of Song (buffs and healing auras)
- Fury → God of Thunder (offensive power, weather control)
- Sorrow → God of Silence (stealth, protection, void magic)
- Awe → God of Harmony (balance, multi-element mastery)

This is a permanent, world-altering choice. The recalled god becomes an ambient presence in the game world, affecting weather, NPC behavior, and available side quests.

## Template NPCs

In addition to the 19 named characters, the world is populated by template-based generic NPCs drawn from 6 archetypes (see [dialogue-bank.md](dialogue-bank.md) Part 11):
- Personality-keyed dialogue variants filled from authored NPC properties
- Variable interpolation (`{zone}`, `{mood}`, `{vibrancy_tier}`) for contextual flavor
- Micro-quest hooks tied to zone vibrancy thresholds

These NPCs are the "connective tissue" of the world. They can be brightened by memory broadcasting, which evolves their dialogue and unlocks new micro-quests. But they don't drive the main story — that's reserved for named characters.
