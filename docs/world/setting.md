# Setting: The Unfinished World

## The World Is Young

The world of Mnemonic Realms is not ancient, dying, or post-apocalyptic. It is **young and unfinished** — a world still being written into existence by the collective memory of its inhabitants.

The landscape is vivid but incomplete. Some regions are fully formed: lush forests, bustling villages, crystalline rivers. Others exist as half-sketched outlines — shimmering fields where the grass hasn't decided its color yet, mountains whose peaks dissolve into luminous mist, coastlines that shift with each tide of shared memory.

## How Memory Shapes the World

Memory is the world's **building material**. When people remember together — sharing stories, preserving traditions, creating new ones — the world responds:

- **Villages grow** as communities share collective memories of prosperity
- **Biomes evolve** from barren sketches into rich, detailed ecosystems
- **New paths appear** between locations as travelers remember routes into existence
- **Ancient ruins surface** when someone recalls a civilization that dissolved its memories into the land

This is not magic in the traditional sense. It's the fundamental physics of this world. Memory is energy. Sharing memory is creation.

## The Dissolved Civilizations

Previous civilizations didn't collapse, weren't conquered, and didn't fade away. They chose to **dissolve** — breaking their collective memory down into the land, the creatures, and the people who came after. Like composting old growth for fertile soil.

Their legacy is everywhere:
- **Resonance Stones** scattered across the landscape hum with fragments of dissolved memory
- **Ancient creatures** carry behavioral patterns inherited from dissolved civilizations
- **Ruins** are less "abandoned buildings" and more "memory fossils" — structures that partially re-form when enough memory energy passes through them

## The Dormant Gods

The gods of this world are not forgotten and fading. They are **dormant prototypes** — first-draft deities created by the earliest civilizations who dissolved before finishing the job.

Each god is an incomplete blueprint waiting for mortals to remix and recall them into new forms. A god of storms might be recalled as a god of renewal. A god of war might be remixed into a god of competition. The gods don't resist this — they were designed for it.

## Geography

### The Brightening Overworld

The overworld is organized around a central hub village and radiates outward into increasingly unfinished territory:

- **The Village (Hub)** — Fully formed, warm, bustling. The most "remembered" place in the world.
- **The Settled Lands** — Farms, roads, neighboring settlements. Well-remembered, stable.
- **The Frontier** — Where memory thins. Landscapes shimmer and shift. New biomes emerge as the player shares memories with the land.
- **The Sketch** — The world's edge. Abstract, luminous, half-formed. Beautiful but unstable. Where the Preservers are strongest.
- **The Depths** — Dungeons and underground spaces where dissolved civilizations left their densest memory deposits.

### Visual Principle

The world gets more vivid, more saturated, more detailed as the player progresses. Early areas start muted and pastel; they bloom into rich color as memories are shared. This is the opposite of the typical RPG pattern where the world gets darker as you approach the endgame.
