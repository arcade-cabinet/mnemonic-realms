# World of Mnemonic Realms

The world is organized as **concentric rings** radiating outward from the village of Everwick. The closer to center, the more "remembered" and fully formed the land. The farther out, the more unfinished, abstract, and unstable.

This is not a political boundary system -- it is a gradient of completion. The world is young, still being remembered into existence. These zones represent how far that process has reached.

## Regions

### [The Settled Lands](settled-lands/index.md) -- Act I

The inner ring surrounding Everwick. Well-remembered regions: farms, roads, hamlets, established forests. They feel lived-in and safe, but the edges show hints of incompleteness.

- [Everwick](settled-lands/everwick.md) -- The eternal settlement (center hub)
- [Heartfield](settled-lands/heartfield.md) -- Rolling farmland to the south
- [Ambergrove](settled-lands/ambergrove.md) -- Dense deciduous forest to the east
- [Millbrook](settled-lands/millbrook.md) -- River town to the west
- [Sunridge](settled-lands/sunridge.md) -- Wind-swept highlands to the north

### [The Frontier](frontier/index.md) -- Act II

The middle ring beyond the Settled Lands. Memory thins noticeably here. The terrain shifts subtly, colors are muted, edges shimmer.

- [Shimmer Marsh](frontier/shimmer-marsh.md) -- Reflective wetlands to the south
- [Hollow Ridge](frontier/hollow-ridge.md) -- Unfinished mountain chain to the north
- [Flickerveil](frontier/flickerveil.md) -- Unstable forest to the east
- [Resonance Fields](frontier/resonance-fields.md) -- Sacred standing-stone plains to the west

### [The Sketch Realm](sketch-realm/index.md) -- Act III

The outer ring -- the world's unfinished edge. Terrain is line-drawn outlines over luminous background. The player must remember areas into solidity to traverse.

- [Luminous Wastes](sketch-realm/luminous-wastes.md) -- Flat expanse of luminous nothing
- [Undrawn Peaks](sketch-realm/undrawn-peaks.md) -- Wireframe mountains
- [Half-Drawn Forest](sketch-realm/half-drawn-forest.md) -- Elegant line-art forest
