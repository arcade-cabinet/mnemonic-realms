# Factions & Forces

## The Mnemonic Architects (Player Faction)

The player belongs to a loose guild of **Mnemonic Architects** — people who have discovered they can actively collect, remix, and broadcast memories to shape the world.

Most people in this world passively generate and share memories through daily life. Mnemonic Architects do it with intention and skill. They are builders, not saviors. Their job isn't to rescue a dying world — it's to help a young world grow.

### What Architects Do
- Collect memory fragments from the environment, NPCs, and dissolved civilizations
- Remix memories into new combinations (the core crafting/progression mechanic)
- Broadcast memories to evolve locations, NPCs, and unlock new content
- Recall dormant gods into new forms
- Push back against the Preservers' stagnation zones

## The Preservers (Antagonist Force)

The Preservers are not evil in the traditional sense. They are **terrified of change**.

They believe the world is already perfect enough. Every new memory risks corrupting what exists. Every remix could destroy something beautiful. Their solution: freeze everything in place. Perfect preservation. Eternal sameness.

### How Preservation Manifests
- **Stagnation Zones**: Areas where time and change have stopped. Everything is crystallized — beautiful but dead. NPCs frozen mid-gesture. Rivers turned to glass. Flowers that will never bloom or wilt.
- **The Museum Effect**: Preserved areas look pristine, even gorgeous. But nothing grows, nothing changes, nothing new is permitted. The horror is subtle — it takes a moment to realize everything is a wax museum.
- **Preserver Agents**: Not monsters — scholars, curators, historians who genuinely believe they're saving the world from chaos. Some are sympathetic. Some are fanatics.

### The Thematic Question
The Preservers force the player (and the game) to grapple with a real question: **Is it better to perfectly preserve what was, or let things evolve into something new and unpredictable?**

There is no easy answer. The game acknowledges that preservation has value — some memories ARE worth keeping intact. The Preservers aren't wrong about everything. But their absolutism — freeze ALL change, permit NO growth — is the destructive extreme.

## The Dissolved

Not a faction so much as a presence. The Dissolved are the echoes of civilizations that chose to break down into the land. They appear as:

- **Resonance Ghosts**: Brief impressions that play out when the player touches memory-dense objects
- **Inherited Behaviors**: Animals and creatures that act out patterns from civilizations they inherited
- **Dream Sequences**: During rest/sleep mechanics, the Dissolved sometimes share perspective fragments

The Dissolved are not hostile. They made their choice and they're at peace with it. But their memories can be powerful, dangerous, or contradictory — and the Preservers desperately want to lock them down before they can be remixed into something new.

## The Dormant Pantheon

The gods are individually detailed in the story documents, but as a faction they represent **potential**. Each dormant god is a question: "What do you want me to become?"

The player's choices in recalling gods have permanent consequences for the world state. A god recalled as nurturing behaves differently than the same god recalled as fierce.
