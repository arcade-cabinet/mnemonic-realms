Subtle shading with 2-3 tone depth per surface. No outlines on tiles, clean edges on sprites. Bright, hopeful color philosophy — the world gets MORE vivid as it progresses, never darker. Think: watercolor sketch evolving into illuminated manuscript evolving into stained-glass cathedral light. Portraits are 16-bit JRPG style, head and shoulders, for dialogue boxes.",
