  "styleGuide": "16-bit JRPG pixel art style. Clean, readable sprites with limited color palette per tile. Warm, inviting aesthetic inspired by SNES-era RPGs (Chrono Trigger, Secret of Mana, Final Fantasy VI). 2-3 head-tall chibi proportions for characters. 32x32 pixel tile grid. Subtle shading with 2-3 tone depth per surface. No outlines on tiles, clean edges on sprites. Bright, hopeful color philosophy — the world gets MORE vivid as it progresses, never darker. Think: watercolor sketch evolving into illuminated manuscript evolving into stained-glass cathedral light. Icons are 32x32, SNES-style.",
