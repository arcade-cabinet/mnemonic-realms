Warm, inviting aesthetic inspired by SNES-era RPGs (Chrono Trigger, Secret of Mana, Final Fantasy VI). 2-3 head-tall chibi proportions for characters. 32x32 pixel tile grid. Subtle shading with 2-3 tone depth per surface. No outlines on tiles, clean edges on sprites. Bright, hopeful color philosophy — the world gets MORE vivid as it progresses, never darker. Think: watercolor sketch evolving into illuminated manuscript evolving into stained-glass cathedral light. Icons are 32×32, SNES-style inventory icons on transparent backgrounds.",

Warm, inviting aesthetic inspired by SNES-era RPGs (Chrono Trigger, Secret of Mana, Final Fantasy VI). 2-3 head-tall chibi proportions for characters. 32x32 pixel tile grid. Subtle shading with 2-3 tone depth per surface. No outlines on tiles, clean edges on sprites. Bright, hopeful color philosophy — the world gets MORE vivid as it progresses, never darker. Think: watercolor sketch evolving into illuminated manuscript evolving into stained-glass cathedral light.\n\n16-bit RPG item icon, 32×32 pixels. Sky blue crystal shard with gentle steady glow, no sparkle, peaceful. Distinct glowing effect, readable at small size. Transparent background.",
